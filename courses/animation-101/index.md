Animation using CSS can be overwhelming to learn all at once.

This course breaks up lessons into 20 emails. Each one should take around 10 minutes to read and a few minutes to follow through the homework. By mixing theory with practical lessons, you'll learn how, and why to use animation on your web pages.

**Note:** You can now get this course as a <a href="http://eepurl.com/dPELWj">FREE book here</a>.

By the end of four weeks you will have a good understanding of CSS transitions and animations, and how to apply them to your work.

## Who this course is for

This course is for people who build for the web and want to add animation to their designs and sites. A bit of basic CSS knowledge is needed but I won't assume any knowledge of transitions or animations. We'll start with the basics, and through a mix of theory and practical examples, learn all about transitions and animation.
