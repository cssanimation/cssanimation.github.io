Today's a big day. We passed [**5,000** Twitter followers](https://twitter.com/cssanimation) (hi everyone!), and I have news for you about a new course I'm launching very soon.

I'd like to give **you** the opportunity to be one of the very first to enjoy the course, [for just **$1**](#id-buy-that-for-a-dollar)!

## Practical and useful lessons

It's almost exactly 2 years since I launched [CSS Animation 101](https://cssanimation.rocks/courses/animation-101/) as an email-based intro to CSS animation. More than 2,000 of you have enjoyed the course and I've had loads of great feedback and suggestions.

Many people have been in touch to ask how they should apply these skills to real projects. 

To answer this I'm creating a new course that will focus on the practical step-by-step work of creating an animated landing page. You'll learn how to apply your technical knowledge and get expert advice on what to do and what to avoid.

## Trying something new

This time I'll be trying something new. I'd like you all to join me on the creative journey of building and recording the course. To do this, I'll be releasing each module one at a time.

The first module will be arriving at the end of March. After that, I'll be listening to your thoughts, and bringing out a new module every few weeks. Each module builds on the last and works toward creating a complete, working animated landing page.

Topics we'll be covering include:

* Build an impressive animation header to show off your brand
* Make designs feel alive with touch and hover animations
* Trigger custom animations when scrolling
* Use animation to grab attention
* Build an animated content carousel
* Putting together your own animation library using Sass
* And more modules added over time (your feedback counts)!

Each module will come with downloadable code you can use *today* on your projects. Once you enrol, you'll get lifetime access to all modules as well as any future modules I add.

## Social learning

As well as video lessons, downloadable code and cheatsheets - you'll also get access to the exclusive CSS Animation Rocks Slack channel. Share your work, questions and ideas and get help as you learn CSS Animation.

## Sneak peak

Want an early glimpse of the course? You can [see the Super-secret pre-launch course page now](http://courses.cssanimation.rocks/p/level-up) for more info. Sshhh! (I'm kidding, tell everyone!)

## I'd buy that for a dollar

*Shut up and take my money* you say? Just a minute! How much would you want to pay for such a useful, professional course? $1000? $300? How about **$1**? ðŸ˜²
