title: Make money with CSS Animation Rocks
---

CSS Animation Rocks is all about the great things that can be done with CSS. Through step by step tutorials, the site helps people understand some of the more tricky aspect of animating with CSS, while providing inspiration and ideas.

There's also a great [CSS animation email course](/courses/animation-101/) that introduces people to the concepts and how it all works.

Would you like to help, and earn some money too?

## Option 1: Be an affiliate

Help promote the CSS Animation course and you will earn a massive *16%* of each sale. That's $10 for each $59 signup.

How it works:

* Sign up [with Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/invite/cssanimation)
* Then, [let me know](mailto:hello@cssanimation.rocks)
* I'll set you up as an affiliate and you'll receive a link you can share

Gumroad is the site that manages sales of the course. Make sure to let me know which email you sign up with and I'll then be able to register you to create your link.

When people then use your link, you'll be paid if they sign up.

[Email me](mailto:hello@cssanimation.rocks) with any questions or if you're interested in becoming an affiliate.

## Option 2: Write

Want to contribute to this site? I'm currently putting the pieces together but it would be great to have your input. If you have an idea for an article, [get in touch](mailto:hello@cssanimation.rocks). Ideally you want to include:

* What aspect of CSS animation it teaches or demonstrates
* A demo or set of demos that illustrate it

All published contributions will of course be paid.
