I can't believe it's been a year since I launched [CSS Animation Weekly](http://weekly.cssanimation.rocks), a regular digest of hand-picked CSS animation inspiration and tutorials. In that time we've seen almost 500 examples of amazing animation work, tutorials and articles.

To celebrate issue #52 of the email, I'm giving away 10 places on my [new CSS animation course](http://courses.cssanimation.rocks/p/level-up?code=friend) with a massive *$140* each. Want to win a place? It's easy!

To win yourself a place on this course, all you need to do is retweet [this tweet](https://twitter.com/cssanimation/status/889219091898277888):
